# StyledFontGAN
The original intent of this project was to create a generative adversarial network that, given a single image of a letter, will generate the remaining characters in the alphabet (A-Z.)

## Motivation Behind This Project
This is a simple project that I've been using to teach myself all about GANs, and getting familiar with Python. I don't claim to be talented when it comes to machine learning, but I want to understand it's capabilities and the challenges that can arise.

## Architecture

The most succcessful model has been trained with the following generator and discriminators, and using an **L1 Loss** for the Generator, and the loss from **WGAN-GP** (Wasserstein Distance + Gradiant Penality) for the Discriminator.

### Generator Architecture

The thought process behind this network architecture is not well informed. The inuition is that we take an image, extract its features with Conv layers, turn it into some intermediate format within the Linear layers, then use that intermediate format to generate a new image using the ConvTranspose layers.

The result is good, but it's not ideal. Currently working on identifying what layers are actually contributing and determining if there are layers that are unnecessary.

```
Sequential(
  (0): Conv2d(1, 1024, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1))
  (1): LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.2)
  (2): Conv2d(1024, 512, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1))
  (3): LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.2)
  (4): Conv2d(512, 256, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1))
  (5): LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.2)
  (6): Flatten()
  (7): Linear(in_features=1024, out_features=256, bias=True)
  (8): ReLU()
  (9): Linear(in_features=256, out_features=5120, bias=True)
  (10): ReLU()
  (11): Unflatten()
  (12): BatchNorm2d(256, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)
  (13): ConvTranspose2d(256, 128, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1))
  (14): BatchNorm2d(128, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)
  (15): ReLU()
  (16): ConvTranspose2d(128, 64, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1))
  (17): BatchNorm2d(64, eps=1e-05, momentum=0.1, affine=True, track_running_stats=True)
  (18): ReLU()
  (19): ConvTranspose2d(64, 1, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1))
  (20): Sigmoid()
)
```

### Discriminator Architecture

This follows DC-GAN. No magic, or added things here. As with the linked papers from above, we do not apply batch normalization which helps with training.

```
(Sequential(
   (0): Conv2d(1, 16, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1))
   (1): LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.2)
   (2): Conv2d(16, 32, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1))
   (3): LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.2)
   (4): Conv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1))
   (5): LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.2)
   (6): Conv2d(64, 128, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=(2, 2), padding=(1, 1))
   (7): LeakyReLU(negative_slope=0.2)
   (8): Flatten()
   (9): Linear(in_features=640, out_features=1, bias=True)
   (10): Sigmoid()
 ),
```

## Results


## Setup
1. Install `pytorch`: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
2. For now, you will also need a tool to view notebooks. I use Jupyter.
3. You need the font dataset. Sneakernet for now.
4. Dependencies: TBD
